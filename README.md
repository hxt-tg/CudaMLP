# CudaMLP
A MLP implementation on multicore processors with Cuda. For final assignment of multi-core processors course.

## Technical features

- Computational intensive
- Efficient training and fitting
- Easily portable and expandable
- Lightweight and friendly program interface

## TODO

- [ ] CUDA or CPU parallel?
- [ ] API design
- [ ] Algebra calculation module
- [ ] Data feeding module
- [ ] MLP training module
- [ ] Unit test

## TODO (Depend on time)
- [ ] Reinforcement learning application (e.g. DQN)
- [ ] Optimize IO with coroutine in C++20.
